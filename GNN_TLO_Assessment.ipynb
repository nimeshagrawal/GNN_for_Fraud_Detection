You'll have fun experimenting with functions and learning to sample batches of sub-graphs for training. Make sure to complete this part before the end of week 1. There are 3 sections in this part, each section is worth 5 points.\n",

Individuals with over 80% helpful votes are identified as benign entities, while those with fewer than 20% helpful votes are considered fraudulent entities. Performing a fraudulent user detection task on the Amazon dataset involves a binary classification process. Each of these users have a 25-dim dense feature representation that is obtained by calculating certain statistical properties of the user's behaviors. Features include properties like entropy of user's ratings, time entropy, sentiment of user's reviews etc. You can learn more about the features from Table 1. in the paper-https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10150.pdf.\n",

The file provided contains connections between users exhibiting the top 5% mutual review text similarities (calculated using TF-IDF) among all users.

    "<h4>Data Sampling</h4>\n",
    "As touched upon in the reading material, graphs possess a relational nature, distinguishing them from datasets like images or text, which maintain a fixed context window. Consequently, when sampling a node for training, it's essential to also sample the neighbors we want to include for aggregation. We'll delve deeper into the GCN model next week, but for now, remember that graph neural networks learn from both node-specific information (i.e., node features) and structural information (a node's neighborhood). As a result, data batches typically consist of a node's subgraph, including its neighborhood in a particular manner. For example, we can consider a node's first and second hop neighbors as its neighborhood. Alternatively, we could use a fixed number of neighbors (either randomly or through a ranking process) in each hop, commonly referred to as fan-out. So, when we say \"sample a node's first-hop neighborhood with fan-out of 5,\" it means we select a total of 5 neighbors from the node's first hop. In this section, we use DGL's in-built neighbor sampler for obtaining batches of node data. \n"
